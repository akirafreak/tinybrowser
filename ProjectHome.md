TinyBrowser was originally created as a custom file browser for TinyMCE - there were several TinyMCE browsers already available but none offered the feature set required.

The project has been expanded to offer standalone support for integration into any web application, along with a custom implementation option for FCKeditor.

Some TinyBrowser features:

  * Adobe Flash based file uploader, supporting multiple file selection and upload with file type and size filtering (permission based)
  * Browse files with a list view or as thumbnails (images only)
  * List view has image thumbnail on hover
  * File display order customisable e.g. by name, type, size, date
  * Find function to filter results by search string
  * Display detailed file information such as type, size and dimensions (images only)
  * File deletion facility (permission based)
  * File edit facility (permission based) - rename, resize and rotate (last two images only)
  * File storage location user definable for each file type
  * Optional session control
  * Many user definable settings, all from central configuration file
